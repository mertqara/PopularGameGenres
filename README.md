# VideoGameGenreShiftOvertime-DSA210Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I will analyse the correlation between video game genres and their release year in game industry. By analyzing the datas, I want to understand why their preferences changed and why the gaming industry preferences are shifted over time. Hopefully, at the end of my project I want to find out that if the indie game companies or big companies have a role in shift. Also, I will explore whether regional differences impact the popularity of certain genres. Do players in different parts of the world like different types of games?

## Data Analysis

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
For this project, I will use publicly available dataset that contains information on video game genres, release years, publishers, and regional sales. 
- Cleaned and filtered data from public dataset from kaggle.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
After cleaning the data. I will do Exploratory data analysis
- **Genre Distribution Over Time:** Identify which genres were most popular in different time periods.
- **Sales Trends:** Analyze whether certain genres perform better in sales.
- **Indie vs. AAA Impact:** Compare whether indie studios or major gaming companies drive genre shifts.
- **Regional Influence:** Examine if genre preferences vary by region based on sales data.

I will also visualize summary statistics and look for outliers or inconsistencies that may affect later analysis.

### **3. Correlation Analysis**
To find a relationships between variables, I will conduct a correlation analysis between:
- **Genre vs. Release Year:** Check if some genres have become more or less common over time.
- **Game Ratings vs. Popularity:** Investigate whether higher-rated games contribute to long-term genre trends.
- **Major Company vs. Indie Company Influence:** Determine if major studios or indie developers have influenced the rise or fall of certain genres.
- **Regional Preferences:** Compare genre popularity across different regions to identify market differences.
This analysis will help determine whether certain factors have a statistically significant impact on video game trends.

### **4. Visualization**
To clearly show correlations between variable I will use various data visualation techniques:
- **Time Series Charts**
- **Heatmaps**
- **Bar Charts & Pie Charts**
- **Scatter Plots**
These visualizations will help me in my conclusions.
