# VideoGameGenreShiftOvertime-DSA210Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I will analyse the correlation between video game genres and their release year in game industry. By analyzing the datas, I want to understand why their preferences changed and why the gaming industry preferences are shifted over time. Hopefully, at the end of my project I want to find out that if the indie game companies or big companies have a role in shift. Also, I will explore whether regional differences impact the popularity of certain genres. Do players in different parts of the world like different types of games?
